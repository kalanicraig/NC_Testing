7/16/2022 (my first visit to this pilate studio): This is a photo taken of a pilates reformer. Once Joseph opened his own studio in the 1920s, he refined the design of the Pilates reformer and incorporated this into his exercise system. This reformer is from a pilates studio that I visit often. I feel relaxed and happy whenever I visit the studio. Pilate itself brings me concentration and joy. I visit the pilates studio at least once a week. Last year, when I was upset, I visited it three times a week. It is therapy for me.
